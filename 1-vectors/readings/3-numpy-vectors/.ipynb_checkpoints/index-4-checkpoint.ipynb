    "As you may have suspected, we can work with vectors in Python.  Now, one way to do this, would be simply to use lists in Python to represent our vectors and matrices.  But this isn't such a good idea.  As we go on to learn some operations we can perform with vectors (like adding and multiplying), we'll want a library that can also perform those operations.  Python isn't directly designed for this, but another library, Numpy, is."
