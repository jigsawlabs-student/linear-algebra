    "In this lesson, we learned about vectors.  Vectors are an ordered list of values.  For clarity, we may write variables with an arrow to express that they represent a vector, $\\vec x$.  And we also may denote a vector $x$ as $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ where $n$ is the number of entries.  Finally, we can refer to a specific entry in a vector with the notation $x_i$ where i refers to the index of an entry.  Unlike in programming, in math we begin with the index of 1 instead of 0. "
