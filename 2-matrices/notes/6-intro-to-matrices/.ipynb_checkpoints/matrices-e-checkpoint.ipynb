    "In this lesson, we learned about working with matrices.  We saw that matrices are a rectangular array of values consisting of both rows and columns.  We often represent ourÂ set of feature variables as a matrix, with each row representing an observation, and each column a separate feature.  We saw that we can describe a particular entry in a matrix by first specifying the row of a matrix and then the column.  \n",

    "We saw that we can create a matrix in numpy by passing through a nested list to the `np.array` method.  We can then select entries by specifying the row followed by the column of the desired entry.  Or if we wish to select all entries from a row or column, instead of specifying an index, we instead use the `:`."
